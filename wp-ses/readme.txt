== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get support for the plugin? =

If you upgrade to [WP Offload SES](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-offload-ses/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BOffload%2BSES&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting), we will gladly provide you with email support. We take pride in delivering exceptional customer support. We do not provide email support for the free version.

= What are the minimum requirements? =

* Latest version of WordPress or the one previous
* PHP 5.5+ compiled with the cURL extension
* MySQL 5.5+
* Apache 2+ or Nginx 1.4+
* Amazon Web Services account

= Can you help me about... (an Amazon concern) =

We are not otherwise linked to Amazon or Amazon Web Services.
Please direct your specific Amazon questions to Amazon support.

= How does this work on WordPress Multisite? =

You can configure the entire network to use the same settings by configuring the plugin via the Network Admin settings screen. If a subsite should have different settings, you can override some or all of the network settings by going to the WP Offload SES Lite settings page for that subsite.

You can also use the `WPOSES_SETTINGS` constant to define settings that will be applied to all subsites and can’t be overridden via the UI:

	define( 'WPOSES_SETTINGS', serialize( array(
		// Send site emails via Amazon SES.
		'send-via-ses'          => true,
		// Enable open tracking.
		'enable-open-tracking'  => true,
		// Enable click tracking.
		'enable-click-tracking' => true,
		// Amazon SES region (e.g. 'us-east-1' - leave blank for default region).
		'region'                => 'us-east-1',
		// Changes the default email address used by WordPress
		'default-email'         => 'your-email@example.com',
		// Changes the default email name used by WordPress.
		'default-email-name'    => 'Your Name Here',
		// Sets the "Reply-To" header for all outgoing emails.
		'reply-to'              => 'your-email@example.com',
		// Sets the "Return-Path" header used by Amazon SES.
		'return-path'           => 'your-email@example.com',
		// Amount of days to keep email logs (e.g. 30, 60, 90, 180, 365, 730)
		'log-duration'          => '30',
	) ) );

See our [documentation](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-offload-ses/doc/settings-constants/?utm_campaign=WP%2BOffload%2BSES&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting) on this for more information.

= Do you have a hook that is fired when an email is sent? =

Yes, the `wposes_mail_sent` hook could be used to log emails, or post email info to an API or database:

	function myMailSentHook( $to, $subject, $message, $headers, $attachments ) {
		// Your code here.
	}
	add_action( 'wposes_mail_sent', 'myMailSentHook', 10, 5 );

= Can I create a translation for your plugin? =

Yes, please do! It's easy.

1. Visit [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org)
1. Choose your locale
1. Click on *Plugins*
1. Search for *WP Offload SES Lite*
1. Click on WP Offload SES Lite
1. Translate!

= Will WP Offload SES Lite work with other plugins that send email? =

Yes, WP Offload SES should be compatible with any plugin that uses the standard `wp_mail()` function for sending email. If you’ve found a plugin that isn’t using that function for sending mail, you may want to reach out to the plugin developer and see if that can be changed.

= Why aren't my AWS access keys working? =

Please double check the credentials match up with the credentials you received when creating your IAM user, and that your IAM user has the `AmazonSESFullAccess` permission.
