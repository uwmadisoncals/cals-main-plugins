This will also result in having large thumbnails!
It is recommended to have the two settings checked.
Front-end upload photo sizes can only be limited by Table VII-B10.x. If VII-D3 or VII-D4 are UNchecked, you may expect out of memory errors.

If you update to wppa version 6.8.02 and use SCABN, you MUST install the special - fixed - version to maintain compatibility.

* On most installations you will no longer see failed uploads due to memory limitations.
When there is not enough memory to downsize photos or to apply watermarks, downsizing will be skipped.
Note that in those cases one can have copies of the original photofiles as thumbnail images.
If this happens often, it is rcommended to set an upload size limit in Table VII-B10.2 to force users to upload smaller images,
or to ask the hosting provider to increase the available sever memory.
* Created a fixed version of plugin Simple Cart & Buy Now. You will need this special version if you previously used Simple Cart & Buy Now in combination with wppa.
