* Sourcefiles got erroneoulsy removed in certain circumstances.

This also happened when a photo was deleted and re-uploaded before the background process actually removed the files of the deleted photo.
This issue has been fixed.
* w#hrurl and w#pl in photo descriptions got wrong results when the filename contained spaces or brackets. Fixed.
* Fixes for compatibility with plugin Simple Cart & By Now. This plugin is not maintained for over three years.
If you update to wppa version 6.8.02 and use SCABN, you MUST install the special - fixed - version to maintain compatibility.

* You can now add browser specific css. Table IV-A15.x.
* If the user has the right to import, there is a button on the album admin screen to import to the album, like the upload to this album button.
* Added links to upload and import pages on the album admin main page, dependant of user rights.

= Other Changes =

* On most installations you will no longer see failed uploads due to memory limitations.
When there is not enough memory to downsize photos or to apply watermarks, downsizing will be skipped.
Note that in those cases one can have copies of the original photofiles as thumbnail images.
If this happens often, it is rcommended to set an upload size limit in Table VII-B10.2 to force users to upload smaller images,
or to ask the hosting provider to increase the available sever memory.
* Created a fixed version of plugin Simple Cart & Buy Now. You will need this special version if you previously used Simple Cart & Buy Now in combination with wppa.
