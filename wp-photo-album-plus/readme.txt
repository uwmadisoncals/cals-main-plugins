== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* The plugin requires at least wp version 3.1.
* The theme should have a call to wp_head() in its header.php file and wp_footer() in its footer.php file.
* The theme should load enqueued scripts in the header if the scripts are enqueued without the $in_footer switch (like wppa.js and jQuery).
* The theme should not prevent this plugin from loading the jQuery library in its default wp manner, i.e. the library jQuery in safe mode (uses jQuery() and not $()).
* The theme should not use remove_action() or remove_all_actions() when it affects actions added by wppa+.
Most themes comply with these requirements.
However, check these requirements in case of problems with new installations with themes you never had used before with wppa+ or when you modifies your theme.
* The server should have at least 64MB of memory.

= Standard installation when not from the wp plugins page =
* Unzip and upload the wppa plugin folder to wp-content/plugins/
* Make sure that the folder wp-content/uploads/ exists and is writable by the server (CHMOD 755, some systems need CHMOD 777)
* Activate the plugin in WP Admin -> Plugins.
* If, after installation, you are unable to upload photos, check the existance and rights (CHMOD 755, some systems need CHMOD 777) of:
for the single site mode installation: the folders .../wp-content/uploads/wppa/ and .../wp-content/uploads/wppa/thumbs/,
and for the multisite mode installation (example for blog id 92): the folders path: .../wp-content/blogs.dir/92/wppa/ and .../wp-content/blogs.dir/92/wppa/thumbs/.
In rare cases you will need to create them manually. You can see the actual pathnames and urls in the lowest table of the Photo Albums -> Settings page.
* If you upgraded from WP Photo Album (without plus) and you had copied wppa_theme.php and/or wppa_style.css
to your theme directory, you must remove them or replace them with the newly supplied versions. The fullsize will be reset to 640 px.
See Table I-A1 and Table I-B1,2 of the Photo Albums -> Settings admin page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do i have to do when converting to multisite? =

* If your WP installation is a new installation and you want to have only one - global - WPPA system, add to wp-config.php:
**define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_GLOBAL', true );**
* If your WP installation is a new installation and you want to have a separate WPPA system for each sub-site, add to wp-config.php:
**define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_INDIVIDUAL', true );**
* If your WP installation is older than 3.5 an you want to have only one - global - WPPA system, ad to wp-config.php:
**define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_GLOBAL', true );**
* If your WP installation is older than 3.5 an you want to have a separate WPPA system for each sub-site, add to wp-config.php:
**define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_BLOGSDIR', true );**
* If you want to convert your multisite WP installation that is prior to 3.5 to a version later than 3.5 and you want to convert an existing WPPA multisite installation
to the new multisite standards, do the following:
1. Update WP to version 3.5 or later.
1. Upate WPPA+ to version 5.4.7 or later.
1. Perform the network migration utility from the network admin which moves all the files from wp-content/blogs.dir/xx to wp-content/uploads/sites/xx
1. **Add** to wp-config.php: **define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_INDIVIDUAL', true );**
1. If it is there, **Remove** from wp-config.php: **define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_BLOGSDIR', true );**

= Which other plugins do you recommand to use with WPPA+, and which not? =

* Recommanded plugins: qTranslate, WP Super Cache, Cube Points, Simple Cart & Buy Now, Google-Maps-GPX-Viewer.
* Plugins that break up WPPA+: My Live Signature.
* Google Analytics for WordPress will break the slideshow in most cases when *Track outbound clicks & downloads:* has been checked in its configuration.

= Which themes have problems with wppa+ ? =

* Photocrati has a problem with the wppa+ embedded lightbox when using page templates with sidebar.

= Are there special requirements for responsive (mobile) themes? =

* Yes! Go to the Photo Albums -> Settings admin page. Enter **auto** in Table I-A1. Lowercase letters, no quotes.
* Do not use size="[any number]", use size="0.80" for 80% with etc.
* If you use the Slideshow widget, set the width also to **auto**, and the vertical alignment to **fit**.
* You may also need to change the thumbnail sizes for widgets in *Table I-F 2,4,6 and 8*. Set to 75 if you want 3 columns in the theme *Responsive*.

= After update, many things seem to go wrong =

* After an update, always clear your browser cache (CTRL+F5) and clear your temp internetfiles, this will ensure the new versions of js files will be loaded.
* And - most important - if you use a server side caching program (like WP Total Cavhe) clear its cache.
* Make sure any minifying plugin (like W3 Total Cache) is also reset to make sure the new version files are used.
* Visit the Photo Albums -> Settings page -> Table VII-A1 and press Do it!
* When upload fails after an upgrade, one or more columns may be added to one of the db tables. In rare cases this may have been failed.
Unfortunately this is hard to determine.
If this happens, make sure (ask your hosting provider) that you have all the rights to modify db tables and run action Table VII-A1 again.

= How does the search widget work? =

* A space between words means AND, a comma between words means OR.
Example: search for 'one two, three four, five' gives a result when either 'one' AND 'two' appears in the same (combination of) name and description.
If it matches the name and description of an album, you get the album, and photo vice versa.
OR this might apply for ('three' AND 'four') OR 'five'.
If you use indexed search, the tokens must be at least 3 characters in length.

= How can i translate the plugin into my language? =

* See the documentation on the WPPA+ Docs & Demos site: http://wppa.opajaap.nl/?page_id=1349

= How do i install a hotfix? =

* See the documentation on the WPPA+ Docs & Demos site: http://wppa.opajaap.nl/?page_id=823

= What to do if i get errors during upload or import photos? =

* It is always the best to downsize your photos to the Full Size before uploading. It is the fastest and safest way to add photos to your photo albums.
Photos that are way too large take unnessesary long time to download, so your visitors will expierience a slow website.
Therefor the photos should not be larger (in terms of pixelsizes) than the largest size you are going to display them on the screen.
WP-photo-album-plus is capable to downsize the photos for you, but very often this fails because of configuration problems.
Here is explained why:
Modern cameras produce photos of 7 megapixels or even more. To downsize the photos to either an automaticly downsized photo or
even a thumbnail image, the server has to create internally a fullsize fullcolor image of the photo you are uploading/importing.
This will require one byte of memory for each color (Red, Green, Blue) and for every pixel.
So, apart form the memory required for the server's program and the resized image, you will need 21 MB (or even more) of memory just for the intermediate image.
As most hosting providers do not allow you more than 64 MB, you will get 'Out of memory' errormessages when you try to upload large pictures.
You can configure WP to use 128 MB (That would be enough in most cases) by specifying *define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '128M');* in wp-config.php,
but, as explained earlier, this does not help when your hosting provider does not allows the use of that much memory.
If you have control over the server yourself: configure it to allow the use of enough memory.
Oh, just Google on 'picture resizer' and you will find a bunch of free programs that will easily perform the resizing task for you.

== Changelog ==

See for additional information: <a href="http://www.wppa.nl/changelog/" >The documentation website</a>

= 6.6.11 =

= Bug Fixes =

* Adjusted the calculation for the size of the thumbnail image files to take into account when responsive cover images are used.
* Responsive cover images not always worked. Fixed.
* When VII-B-12 (Fe alert) was unchecked and the fe upload is blogged, the redirect to the blog post failed. Fixed.
* Max one alertbox on fe upload/blog. Select when in Table VII-B12.
* Fixed a possible errormessage on fe delete photo.

= New Features =

* Table VIII-B12.2 Add HD tags. All photoa that are available in resolution >= 1920 x 1080 px get tag HD.
* Albums can have their own watermark settings. New uploaded photos will have that watermark in stead of the system default as specified in Table IX-F.

= Other Changes =

* You can disable the shortcode generator in Table IX-B19 for users who are neither administrator nor wppa superuser.
* Tags GPX and HD will always be in capital letters. Existing tags can be fixed using Table VIII-B16 Fix Tags.
* The caching of wppa options has been removed to avoid problems on systems that do not allow db fields > 64kB.
* The togo-field of running cron jobs (Table VIII) is now being updated every 5 seconds.

= 6.6.10 =

= Bug Fixes =

* Under certain circumstances the granted album was not created. Fixed: It is no longer required to have an upload widget on the members page.

= New Features =

* New shortcode attribute: alt="...". The alt attrinute may conatin an existing photo id number.
In case the shortcode can not be rendered, you used to see the 'placeholder' [WPPA+ Photo display (fsh)].
In some circumstances this is not due to a configuration issue, but you can e.g. have plugin AMP installed and AMP applies to the content.
When the alt attribute is added to the shortcode, a plain photo will be displayed. If you do not want anything to be displayed (no photo and no errormessage)
set the alt attrinbute to none: alt="none". Full shortcode example: [wppa type="slide" album="255" alt="4187"]Any comment[/wppa]

= Other Changes =

* It is no longer possible to delete a photo that is explicitly used as a single image in a post or page.
* After Blog it! (front-end upload) You will now be redirected to the post you blogged.
* Table II-B0: Navigation type. Can be set to one out of: 'Icons', 'Icons on mobile, text on pc' or 'Text'.
This makes the old text style coming back for those who really want it.
* Table II-H16: Blog it! is now a selectionbox. You can select one out of: disabled, optional and always.
This makes it possible to force users to blog their uploads.
* You can now have responsive album cover images. Table I-D5.x and I-D6.x

= 6.6.09 =

= Bug Fixes =

* Fixed a spurious db error on certain search ops resulting in erroneously nothing found.
* Related count was not obeyed. Fixed.

= New Features =

* Photo viewcounts can now be displayed under the album cover photo. Table II-E9: Viewcount on cover.
* Table IV-C10: Run nl2br or wpautop on description. For thumbnail text.

= Other Changes =

* The treecounts system (number of sub-albums, photos, pending and scheduled as well as photo viewcounts)
has been re-implemented; data is now stored in the albums table.
Viewing admin pages cause immediate recalculation, so admin pages always show correct numbers.
On the foreground - to reduce overhead actions that may slow down pageloads for visitors -
the updates are done in a background process (cron job) and may result in max 30 seconds delay after upload,
create sub album or viewing fs images.
* On some systems it has been shown that the eventhandler for onload is not executed on svg images.
To avoid svg navigation icons from not getting the right colors and showing up,
the function wppaReplaceSvg() is now called at various smart moments.
* The album cover text is now wrapped in a div rather than a p to avoid layout problems when Table IV-D8 is set to 'Linebreaks and paragraphs'.

= 6.6.08 =

= Bug Fixes =

* Fixed an error in the html for google+ share code.
* A running slideshow no longer interrupts running audio.
* Fixed an alignment problem of the audio bar on theme Twenty Seventeen.
* Fixed cursor (is now a pointer) in case a single image has a link to it.
* Fixed a spurious php error in wppa_in_widget().
* Hilite is working again. (Indication on thumbnail when linked from slideshow to thumbnails).

= Other Changes =

* The first/last arrow icons on the filmstrip do no longer show up if the first/last image is displayed.
* Cosmetic changes to filmstrip tooltips (titles).
* Functional enhancements in bulk edit photos i.c. immediate move por photo.

* Table VI-B2: Thumbnail linktype: added option: 'the thumbnails album in a slideshow'. Shows the slideshow of the album where the thumbnail belongs. Starting at the pointed image.
This always shows the physical album where the thumbnail belongs to as a slideshow, even when the collection of thumbnails is the content of a virtual album;
as opposed to 'the fullsize photo in a slidshow' (the default) that always shows the slideshow of the selection where the thumbnail belongs to.

= 6.6.05 =

= New Features =

* Table IV-E11: <i>Rating display type</i> can now be set to 'Likes'. Works on thumbnails (II-D4), slideshow (II-B7) and lightbox (II-G21).

* Table VI-A6: LasTen widget linktype: added option: 'the thumbnails album in a slideshow'. Shows the slideshow of the album where the thumbnail belongs. Starting at the pointed image.

= 6.6.04 =

= Bug Fixes =

* Delete link for pending photos under slide and thumbnail did not work but generated a security check failure. Fixed.
* Uploading photo file formats other than .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .gif at the frontend did not produce an appropriate user errormessage, but resulted in a missing photo and thumbnail. Fixed.
* Fixed initialisation errors that caused a php warning without functional mis-behaviour.
* Settings in Table IX-F3: Watermark file and position were not settable. Fixed.

= New Features =

* The administrator can now use the downloaded db table .csv-files from Table XII for import on the Photo Albums -> Import screen. For backup and for moving to another website/host.
See http://wppa.nl/changelog/installation-notes/#moving
* Max number of albums to show up in a selectionbox on the photo admin screen is now settable in Table IX-B6.2. If this max is exceeded, a number input field is displayed.
* Maintenance proc Table VIII-B8.2 All to lower. Convert file-extensions to lower case. To fix very old systems.
Recommended before moving the site, especially when you use a windows pc to copy the photofiles.
Window does not accept two files with the same name with different case in file extension. It simply overwrites the files.

= Other Changes =

* Various performance improvements.
* Various typos in texts fixed.

= 6.6.03 =

= Bug Fixes =

* On the upload admin screen, when the server allows you to upload as much as gigabytes, you will no longer get the erroneous message that the total filesize is too big.

= 6.6.02 =

= Bug Fixes =
