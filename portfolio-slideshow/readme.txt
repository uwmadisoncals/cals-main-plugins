Build elegant slideshows in seconds.

== Description ==

= A clutter-free slideshow plugin for WordPress =

Portfolio Slideshow adds a simple slideshow builder to posts and pages on your site. Its drag-and-drop interface lets you upload, order, and edit images "on the fly" right on the page.

Once you've arranged your images as you see fit, simply drop the `[portfolio_slideshow]` shortcode anywhere in that post or page, and voila—an elegant, customizable, responsive slideshow will appear on your site.

== Installation ==

= Install & Activate =

Installing the plugin is easy. Just follow these steps:

1. From the dashboard of your site, navigate to Plugins → Add New.
2. Select the Upload option and click "Choose File."
3. When the popup appears, use it to select the Portfolio Slideshow .zip file for the plugin.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait as the upload completes.
5. When it's finished, activate the plugin via the prompt.

= Requirements =

* PHP 5.6.0 or greater (recommended: PHP 7.1 or greater)
* WordPress 4.9 or above

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: How do I insert a slideshow into a post or page? =

A: Upload your photos to the post or page using the "Add Slides" metabox. You can drag-n-drop images into the uploader that pops up, add captions and descriptions to these images, etc.

Then, simply add the shortcode `[portfolio_slideshow]` where you want the slideshow to appear in the page, and publish the post. Nice!

One common mistake is to insert the images into the post using the content editor. This is not necessary – the plugin detects all images attached to the post and creates the slideshow automatically.

= Q: Does the plugin support images that are not uploaded via the media uploader? =

A: No, the plugin does not support random folders of images or images on a third-party site at this time.

= Q: Why isn't my slideshow loading? =

A: If the images show up fine in the "Add Slides" metabox in your admin, but don't on the front-end, this could be a theme conflict. Your best option is to inspect the page with a browser console open, and/or to set `WP_DEBUG` to `true` in your site's `wp-config.php` file to see if any PHP errors show up on your site.

If you can see the first slide of the slideshow, but clicking doesn't do anything, this is almost always a JavaScript conflict from your theme (or another plugin). It could caused by a jQuery library conflict. View the HTML source of the page which is supposed to show the slideshow. Do you see more than one copy of jQuery or the Cycle plugin being loaded? If your theme or other plugins load those same files directly, you will have a conflict. Your best option here is to manually dequeue conflicting scripts. Check out [the `wp_dequeue_script()` function](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_dequeue_script) for more information on doing so.

= Q: I haven't found multiple versions of a conflicting file. In fact, I can't see jQuery Cycle or Portfolio Slideshow's CSS loading at all! What gives? =

If you don't see the jQuery Cycle plugin or Portfoliio Slideshow JavaScript and CSS files being loaded on posts and pages with the `[portfolio_slideshow]`, then 99 times out of 100 this means that your theme is not using the required WordPress theme functions `wp_head()` and/or `wp_footer()`. These functions are *required* for almost all plugins to work correctly, not just Portfolio Slideshow. Please consider using a different theme, or at least contact the theme developer about these missing functions.

= Q: How do I change the size of the images? =

A: By default, the slideshow uses the large-size images that are generated by WordPress when you upload an image. You can change this default in the settings panel for the plugin, or on a per-page basis using the size attribute (see installation instructions for usage).

If you would like to change the size of the images system-wide (for example, you want a large image to be 800px instead of 1025px) you can change the WordPress settings in the "Settings -> Media" control panel. You will need to regenerate your thumbnails to make the setting retroactive. If you're in this situation, I cannot recommend the aptly named Regenerate Thumbnails plugin enough! [Download it here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/). I have used that on sites with thousands and thousands of large images, and it works very well.

== Screenshots ==

1. Example gallery.

2. Use the "Upload and Manage Images" button to add, sort, and delete your photos.

3. Insert the slideshow by using this shortcode, exactly as shown. Do not insert the photos into the post.

4. Settings control panel.

5. Finding the attachment ID for your images.

6. Adding an external URL to a slide.
