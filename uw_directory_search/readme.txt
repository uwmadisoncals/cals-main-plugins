== Description ==

Allows you to add University of Wisconsin-Madison Directory Search (UWDS) tools to your site (i.e. page forms, widgets and shortcode). You can customize the plugin to either search through the whole UW Directory database or just the division of your choosing (e.g. 'Agricultural and Life Sciences', 'Education', 'Engineering', etc.)

FEATURES

* UW Directory search page: select an existing page on your site to display an Ajax-based UWDS form.
* UW Directory widget: activate the UWDS widget to display an Ajax-based UWDS form on your site's sidebar.
* UW Directory shortcode: use the [uw_dir_search name=""] shortcode to automatically look up and display a specific person's phone and email information on a page (for example: "[uw_dir_search name="VIDAL E QUEVEDO ACOSTA"]" will retrieve and display Vidal Quevedo's phone number and email directly from the UW Directory database). This is really useful for creating contact pages, such as this one http://www.cals.wisc.edu/about-cals/administration/dean/.
* UW Division to search: choose between searching through the whole UWDS database or just one division (e.g. 'Agricultural and Life Sciences', 'Education', 'Engineering', etc.)
