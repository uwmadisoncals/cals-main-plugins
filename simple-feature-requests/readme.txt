Prioritise feature requests for your product through user generated content.

== Description ==

If you are a product creator then you'll know how important user feedback can be. Simple Feature Requests aims to make it easier for you to prioritise which features should be included.

The free version of the plugin provides the following features:

* Accept user-submitted feature requests.
* Users can vote on features they want to see included in your product.
* Users can comment on feature requests using the native WordPress commenting system.
* Admins can approve and manage feature requests.
* AJAX based search before a user submits a feature request.
* Sort/filter by "Latest", "Top", "My Requests", and "Status".
* Select status from "Pending", "Published", "Under Review", "Complete", "Started", "Planned", and "Declined".
* Add custom statuses using the `jck_sfr_statuses` filter.

= Pro Version =

The [Pro version](https://simplefeaturerequests.com) of the plugin provides the following *additional* features:

* Categorise feature requests.
* Bulk change request statuses.
* Enable email notifications when a status changes or a comment is added.

[Upgrade to Pro](https://simplefeaturerequests.com)
