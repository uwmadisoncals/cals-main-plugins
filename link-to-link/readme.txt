== Description ==

This plugin permits you to easily create a link using an item from the Wordpress Links Manager. It adds a button to the tinymce and quicktags editors. Clicking the button will open a dialog window that allows you to search for a link and insert it. Link relationships are supported using the "rel" tag and the Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO). The plugin works well together with the BibTeX Importer plugin.
