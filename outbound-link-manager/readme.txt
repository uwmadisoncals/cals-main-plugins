== Description ==

The Outbound Link Manager monitors outbound links in your posts and pages, easily allowing you to add or remove a nofollow tag, update anchor texts, or remove links altogether.

The whitelist + blacklist functions mean you can also set rules around when a nofollow tag should be added.

= Here's what you can do: =

1. Remove links. The original anchor text is kept in tact.
1. Add or remove the NoFollow tag. 
1. Achieve the above in bulk by selecting numerous posts/pages or links.
1. Edit links. This gives you instant access to the whole link code, allowing you to add styles, targets or change the anchor text.
1. Add domains to the whitelist: all other links will be removed or nofollow will be added.
1. Add domains to the blacklist: all links to these domains will be removed or nofollowed, other links will not change.
1. Ignore posts/pages so that they won't show up in the link list again. You can remove these from the ignore list through the options page.

This plugin is aimed at SEO managers who would like to monitor external links. It is also helpful to monitor external links if you are outsourcing your content creation.
