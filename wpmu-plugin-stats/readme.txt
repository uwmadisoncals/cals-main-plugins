Gives network admins an easy way to see what plugins are actively used on the sites of a multisite installation

== Description ==

> The plugin is deprecated and reaches a hard end-of-life date on 31. January 2018!

= Alternative =
You should switch to [Multisite Enhancements](https://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-enhancements/). It provides the same functionality and is actively maintained.

---------------

This plugin gives you a count and the listing of sites using your installed plugins.

Usage data is cached in a Transient (non-autoloading) but the data collection process can be a very expensive operation depending on plugin and (especially) site count.
Check the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpmu-plugin-stats/faq/ "Frequently Asked Questions") for more details on caching.

* __Requires a WordPress Multisite Installation__
* JavaScript is required to toggle the list of sites using a plugin


= Development =
> The plugin has reached its end-of-life. No updates and/or support after 2018-01-31

* GitHub Repository: [wpmu-plugin-stats](https://github.com/wp-repository/wpmu-plugin-stats)

== Installation ==

1. Install by searching "WPMU Plugin Stats" on Plugins > Add New > Search
2. Activate by clicking "Network Activate"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When is the stats data refreshed? =

 - Auto refresh on every plugin activation and deactivation
 - Auto refresh on `network/plugins.php` if Transient is expired (2h/24h on large networks)
 - Manual refresh if you visit `network/plugins.php?manual-stats-refresh=1`

= What happens on large installations =

 - Auto refresh is not running on plugin (de)activation
 - Stats data is being regenerated every 24h (see action `wpmu_plugin_stats_refresh`)

= Hooks =

 - [Filter] `wpmu_plugin_stats_refresh` - Manually set the expiration time of the data (Transient)
